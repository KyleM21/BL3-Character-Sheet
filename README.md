# BL3-Character-Sheet
Hello, welcome to my character sheet program!

To start off, all of the code I've done is in src/FXMLDocumentController.
All files save in the directory of the program by default, but you can choose where to save and load them with file chooser.
I will be putting an .jar of this program in the main directory! It will be called Character-Sheet-XML.jar!
You can test the program by loading the default saved file I put in, called BL3Sheet.xml, and it will take all of the data
from the file and load it into the form!
blank.xml is just a fuel used in testing.

Thank you for checking out my program!
