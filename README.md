# BL3-Character-Sheet

## Run

Download and run "Character Sheet XML.jar", it is found in the main directory

## Description: 

Hello, welcome to my character sheet program!

To start off, all of the code is in the directory "src\character\sheet\xml\". 
All files save in the directory of the program by default, but you can choose where to save and load them with file chooser.
I will be putting an .jar of this program in the main directory! It will be called Character-Sheet-XML.jar!
I provided a preset save file called BL3Sheet.xml, you can use it to test the loading feature of the program.
You can make your own, save it and load it as well!
The file "blank.xml" is just an empty form used in testing.

Thank you for checking out my program!
